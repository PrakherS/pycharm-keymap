# Personal keymap for PyCharm

This is my personal keymap for [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). It's based
on the original *Emacs* keymap for that IDE.

## How to use it

Simple instructions for Mac OS X.

1. Clone this repo
2. cp Emacs-bsnux.xml ~/Library/Preferences/PyCharm50/keymaps/Emacs-bsnux.xml
3. Go to *Preferences... -> Keymap* and select *Emacs-bsnux*
4. Done!

## Tested versions

* PyCharm 5 on Mac OS X 10.10.3
