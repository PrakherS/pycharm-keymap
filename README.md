# Personal keymap for PyCharm

This is my personal keymap for [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). It's based
on the original *Mac OS X 10.5+* keymap for that IDE.

## How to use it

Simple instructions for Mac OS X.

1. Clone this repo
2. cp ./pycharm-keymap/Mac OS X 10_5_ bsnux.xml ~/Library/Preferences/PyCharm50/keymaps/
3. Go to *Preferences... -> Keymap* and select *Mac OX 10.5+ bsnux* option
4. Done!

## Tested versions

* PyCharm 2016.2 on Mac OS X 10.11.3
